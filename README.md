Got it — you want to extend your current **SwipeFeed** flow to handle the **“match happens”** scenario, and then design the **post-match acquisition/onboarding process** in a way that maximizes deal completion while reducing drop-offs.

Here’s how I’d break it down:

---

## **1. Current Flow Recap**

* Buyer/Seller swipes on profiles.
* A **match** happens when both have “accepted” each other.
* Now we must:

  1. Notify both parties.
  2. Show them the match in a **"Matches" tab**.
  3. Begin the onboarding/acquisition journey for this specific match.

---

## **2. Challenges / Friction Points After a Match**

From experience with dating & marketplace apps, the biggest drop-off points are:

1. **Delay in engagement** — users don’t act immediately after matching.
2. **Unclear next steps** — they don’t know what to do next to move the deal forward.
3. **Overwhelming onboarding** — too many questions, forms, or uploads at once.
4. **Mismatched expectations** — one side doesn’t understand the other’s requirements.
5. **Poor communication channel** — slow or inconvenient messaging.

---

## **3. Design Principles for Acquisition After a Match**

We want to **minimize cognitive load** and **increase early commitment**.
That means:

* Break onboarding into **bite-sized, contextual steps**.
* **Leverage the excitement** of the match — immediate small actions.
* Provide **clear visual progress** (like a progress tracker).
* Use **pre-filled data** where possible to reduce typing.

---

## **4. Suggested Post-Match Flow**

### **Step 1: Match Notification**

* **Instant modal** when a match is detected:

  > "🎉 You and John’s Bakery are a match! Let’s set up the deal."
* CTA: “Start Deal Setup” (primary button) + “View Profile” (secondary).
* This keeps them **in the flow**, not just a passive notification.

---

### **Step 2: Minimal Commitment Step**

* First screen only asks **one quick question** to get momentum:

  * Buyer → “What’s your preferred delivery timeline?” (dropdown)
  * Seller → “Can you supply within that timeline?” (yes/no)
* This **creates small psychological investment**.

---

### **Step 3: Guided, Parallel Onboarding**

Instead of a giant form, split into **3–4 micro steps**:

1. **Basic terms** (quantity, delivery time, budget range).
2. **Verification & trust** (business verification doc, GSTIN, or ID).
3. **Logistics** (preferred shipping methods, pickup points).
4. **Review & confirm**.

Both parties **see the other side’s progress** in real time.
Example:

```
John’s Bakery: ✅ Step 1 complete, ⏳ Step 2 pending
You: ✅ Step 1 complete, ✅ Step 2 complete
```

This triggers **social pressure** to complete steps.

---

### **Step 4: Continuous Match Engagement**

* Add a **"Matches" tab** in the UI.
* Each match shows:

  * Profile picture
  * Current onboarding status (“Step 2 of 4 complete”)
  * Quick actions: “Message”, “Finish Setup”, “View Terms”.
* Gamify progress (“You’re 1 step away from finalizing this deal 🚀”).

---

### **Step 5: Messaging + Nudges**

* Open chat immediately after match, but **inline reminders** in chat if onboarding incomplete.
* Example:

  > “Looks like both of you haven’t finalized delivery details yet — tap here to complete.”

---

### **Step 6: Post-Onboarding Action**

Once onboarding done:

* Auto-generate **deal draft** from collected info.
* Give both parties a **one-click confirm** button.
* Trigger **deal tracking dashboard**.

---

## **5. How This Integrates with Your Redux Flow**

Here’s a quick state addition:

```ts
interface Match {
  id: number;
  buyerId: number;
  sellerId: number;
  status: 'pending' | 'onboarding' | 'completed';
  steps: {
    buyer: number; // current step index
    seller: number;
  };
}
```

* When `swipe` is dispatched and results in a match, push a new `Match` object into `matches`.
* `MatchesTab` component reads from `matches` in Redux and displays progress.
* Onboarding form dispatches `updateMatchStep` actions.

---

## **6. Why This Reduces Drop-Off**

* **Immediate action** — keeps momentum high after match.
* **Micro-commitments** — easier than one huge form.
* **Visibility of other’s progress** — social accountability.
* **Progress tracking** — gamifies completion.
* **Parallel onboarding** — both can fill info at same time, faster closing.

---

If you want, I can sketch the **UI for the Matches tab** and **post-match modal** so it fits into your existing `SwipeFeed` + Redux store structure. That way we have both the **UX plan** and **implementation plan** ready.
